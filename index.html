I really enjoyed crafting a new product type called a voucher that basically would have an event that was invoked when an invoice was created that would send a voucher code to the recipient of the product. In order to save time, Unigry’s gift certificate module was extended to complete this project task. A custom widget was created in order to display product listing by category. Single Sign On was integrated between Refinery29 custom framework and the Magento site. Also an API was digested to display Refinery29’s articles on Magento’s platform. In order to make development more streamlined for the newer developers who were unfamiliar with deploying code on a Linux server, GIT was integrated with Jenkins so code could be deployed with a button. Documents produced included a response to a RFP, documentation for a REST API and a scope of work.</li>

Development of modules for their product import and other functions required a strong understanding of Magento internals including the EAV system, cron scheduling system, the inner workings of Adminhtml and of course the module implementation using the XML structure built into Magento. I made use of the design pattern (template pattern) for the import module and integrated it with the MVC pattern Magento uses, and implemented Event/Observer hooks for product import. Documentation was produced for setting up a production server environment. The .NET developers were also setup with Ubuntu desktop environments running in a virtual machine and the Windows System Administrator was trained in using Redhat 5.6 Enterprise Edition. Apache, Cherokee, Mysql, Memcached, and NFS mounts to a remote database server were all integrated and implemented.</li>

I was responsible for mapping category data to SOLR as well as the extra product data. I also worked on making existing API’s stateless (Magento Controller), as well as creating a few new APIs. A Magento Module was designed for storing XML filter information, as well as made use of EAV attributes, which were installed using Magento setup scripts. Working with SOLR, I dealt closely with Magento Indexes as well</li>

                        <li>Toms Shoes, known for their one for one marketing strategy, decided to implement the same strategy for eyewear and launched a new Magento store for eyewear products. I was involved in theming this store as well as implementing a new shared session experience between the two stores. Tracing and profiling was done on Magento’s core using XDebug to understand bottlenecks in high traffic environments. I completed work on the AJAX store locater in order to support multiple stores. PHPUnit was used in development for Unit Tests on modules and functions. Research and development was done on SAML, openSSO, CentralAuth standards, as well as third party solutions implementing those standards. Solutions were load tested and profiled extensively.</li>

The attribute system in Magento was architected against and Unit Tests were written in PHPUnit to confirm that the architected attributes were performing as expected. APIs were written to allow the Zend Framework application to communicate with the Magento Architecture in an easy and simple to understand manner. Consultation was given on numerous occasions to the team lead of the contracted agency to help develop solutions in Magento.</li>

I was asked to integrate an animated, create it yourself gift card that could range from Birthday Cards to Christmas Cards and various other holidays. This was a very challenging but rewarding project because basically gift cards needed to be able to be modified from the shopping cart, as well as emailed to the customer, retrieved and then animated with the cards customization. Magento’s default product type was extended to make this happen. Event hooks in Magento’s Event/ Observer system also facilitated this project.</li>
